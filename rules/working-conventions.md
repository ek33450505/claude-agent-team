# Working Conventions

## Planning
- Run `planner` before any non-trivial change
- Tasks: 15-30 min max; break larger work into chunks
- Each logical unit gets its own commit

## Code Quality
- YAGNI: build only what was asked
- DRY: find existing patterns before inventing new ones
- TDD: write failing tests before implementation for logic-heavy tasks
- MANDATORY: `code-reviewer` after every logical unit of changes
- MANDATORY: Never `git commit` directly — use the `commit` agent
- MANDATORY: Route errors to `debugger` agent, not inline triage
- MANDATORY: Code-modifying agents self-dispatch `code-reviewer` internally
- MANDATORY: All agents end with Status: `DONE` | `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` | `BLOCKED` | `NEEDS_CONTEXT`

## Agent Selection
- `researcher` (sonnet): deep investigation, external sources, recommendations
- `Explore` subagent: fast codebase navigation, file/grep searches

## Testing
- Tests alongside source: `Foo.jsx` -> `Foo.test.jsx`
- Test behavior (`getByRole`/`getByText`), not implementation
- Cover: happy path, edge cases, error states

## SQL / Data
- `db-reader` for read-only exploration
- Optimized queries with filters; BigQuery via `bq query` CLI

## Commits
- MANDATORY: Use `commit` agent — never raw `git commit`
- Imperative mood, concise (`Add feature X`, `Fix bug in Y`)

## Context Management
- Compact at ~60% context (before "dumb zone" at ~70%)
- `/compact` to summarize; `/clear` + `/resume` for fresh start
- Commit before compacting — compact discards tool output history
- Commit at least hourly during implementation sessions
