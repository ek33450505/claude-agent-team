# CHANGELOG

## Phase 2 (2026-03-21)

### Routing System
- **Fixed:** `route.sh` false-positive on internal Claude Code `<task-notification>` XML messages — they now exit cleanly with no output
- **Changed:** Routing hints now instruct Claude to **dispatch agents directly** (not ask-first). The routing loop goes from 4 steps → 1 step.
- **Added:** `no_match` action logged to `routing-log.jsonl` for tracking routing miss rate (future: triggers Haiku router agent when miss rate > 20%)
- **Added:** 4 new routing patterns: `e2e-runner` (playwright/e2e test), `build-error-resolver` (typescript/build errors), `presenter` (slide deck/presentation), `morning-briefing` (daily briefing/schedule)
- **Fixed:** `commit` pattern tightened — no longer fires on "commit to this approach" or similar phrases

### Agents
- **Hardened:** `doc-updater` — added output format section, diff preview workflow, error handling table (was 16/25, now 23/25)
- **Synced:** `e2e-runner` installed version updated to match repo source (generic stack discovery replaces hardcoded project names)
- **Updated:** Agent quality rubric — re-scored `presenter` (14→20), `browser` (16→20), `e2e-runner` (16→23), `doc-updater` (16→23)

### Discoverability
- **Added:** `/help` command — lists all installed agents with model, command, and trigger conditions; explains routing system; shows examples with cost hints

### Installer
- **Updated:** Post-install "Next steps" now includes `/help` and a routing test example

### Branding
- **Renamed:** Project is now officially **CAST — Claude Agent System & Team** (README title updated)
- **Added:** Honest comparison table vs. NanoClaw v2 and Ruflo v3
- **Updated:** Architecture diagram agent/command counts from 23 → 24
- **Updated:** Router section describes Phase 2 auto-dispatch behavior
